        <p> Hello, My name is <span><b>BOBY RAHMAN</b></span>. I'm a professional web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.
        With 4+ years of experience in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in building solutions that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and scalable.
        Proficient in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more, I focus on delivering seamless user experiences and efficient codebases. I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with designers, product managers, and other developers to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p> Whether it's crafting a new digital product from scratch, optimizing existing platforms, or solving complex technical challenges, I approach every project with creativity, precision, and a commitment to excellence.
        When I'm not coding, you’ll often find me exploring the latest tech trends or contributing to open-source projects.
        Let’s build something great together.
        </p>
